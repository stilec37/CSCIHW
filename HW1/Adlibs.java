// make a method that accepts 3 Strings (Someones name, age, and favorite color and then returns a story about them)
// Hint1: The objects name is Adlibs and you require a name age and favoriteColor all in strings
// Hint2: You will need to return a string. You can concat the variables and the strings together
// Hint3: A sample story if you are lost can be as simple as "Hello! My name is ____, and I am ____, and my favorite  
//        color is ___"
public class Adlibs 
{
    public  String story(String name, int age, String favoriteColor) 
    {
        
        
        // String Name = "Cailyn";
        //Adlibs Name = new Adlibs();
        //int Age = 18;
        // Adlibs Age = new Adlibs();
        //String FavoriteColor = "pink";
